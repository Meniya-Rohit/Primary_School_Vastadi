        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>1<sup>st</sup> Standard</h3>
            <p>Education is a must for everyone. People choose to go to higher studies because they want to change their lives and the world 
                around them. Education is vital because it helps us grow, excel and reach our full potential. A short essay on education is a 
                helpful tool for children to understand its importance.</p>
        </div>
    
    
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>2<sup>nd</sup> Standard</h3>
            <p>Education is a basic need for everyone in the modern day to live a good life. It plays an important role in enabling us to use 
                technological systems and services. Well educated people can take up different jobs and become successful in life.</p>
        </div>
    
    
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>3<sup>rd</sup> Standard</h3>
            <p>Education is all about gathering knowledge and training the mind to think and apply reasoning to solve problems. 
                It is the foundation on which any person, society, or country progresses.
                 While our country has grown and developed over time, we may take the value of education for granted</p>
        </div>

        
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>4<sup>th</sup> Standard</h3>
            <p>Children need to know and understand the value of education. Teachers encourage students to reflect upon its significance by writing an essay.
                 Children will need to think of reasons why education is important to them and why it is valuable for society at large.</p>
        </div>
    
    
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>5<sup>th</sup> Standard</h3>
            <p>Education helps us use all the new technology available to us. Educated people can also teach their children well 
                and raise the next generation of educated individuals ready to contribute to society. In this competitive world, 
                education makes a major difference in getting good jobs and employment opportunities.

        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>6<sup>th</sup> Standard</h3>
            <p>It is often said that the home is where education first begins. Parents are the first teachers who teach many 
                important lessons that are useful for life. Education then takes the form of schooling, where children learn about
                 the world. Higher education in the form of college, later on, teaches people specific skills that give them job 
                 opportunities in different fields.</p>

            <h3>7<sup>th</sup> Standard</h3>
            <p>Education is crucial for people from a lower economic background to achieve a better standard of living. A decent schooling and basic education can help children come out of poverty when they grow up.

        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>8<sup>th</sup> Standard</h3>
            <p>The future of a country is shaped by its classrooms. Implementing a sound education system based on a holistic
                 approach to learning is quintessential for ensuring that every student gets the best learning environment to 
                 flourish. As education is the most important and basic right, everyone should have, it is our moral duty to
                  facilitate the perfect learning environment for our students.</p>

        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Primary Education</h3>
            <p>Education is the process which aids learning, acquiring knowledge and skills to oneâ€™s character.</p>

            <h3>School library</h3>
            <p>In our school library, we have various types of books- fictional, non-fictional, literature, books on general knowledge, etc. I love to read storybooks and books on general knowledge which have colourful illustrations. Books in my school library are arranged in such a way that students can find them easily.</p>

            <h3>Larges Play Ground</h3>
            <p>The school playground provides a safe outdoors environment within the school that stimulates children to use their creative energy in healthy interactions with one another. The most enchanting schools always have large, open playgrounds with interesting play equipment that leaves many options for creativity.</p>

            <h3>Testy and healthy food</h3>
            <p>our think that all schools should have a healthy school lunch. It's very important to have nutritious school lunches so that we can be healthy and have energy during the school day. I think we should have better and healthier school menus. Our school menus are very high in cholesterol and saturated fat.</p>
